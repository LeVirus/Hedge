technical details

The game is one of the first FPS in the history, the hardware of the time did not allow 3d render.
So the engine simulate it in a 2d logic. The used technique was called raycasting.
The levels in wolfenstein3d were respresented on a 2d map, to display the elements the engine calculate the distance between the player and 
the concerned element. Depending on the angle and distance the element was displayed in consequences. 

Controls::

we can turn camera in right and left directions, but not up and down.
Obviously we can go forward and backward and shoot. We can change weapons, go to menu.

Menu::

The menu allows to save load a party, to begin a new game after choosing a difficulty.
