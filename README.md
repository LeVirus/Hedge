The game is one of the first FPS in the history, the hardware of the time did not allow 3d render.
So the engine simulate it in a 2d logic. The used technique was called raycasting. 
The levels in wolfenstein3d were respresented on a 2d map, to display the elements the engine calculate the distance between the player and
the concerned element. Depending on the angle and distance the element was displayed in consequences.
